# AUA_ENGS_2020_Car-wash-app
This application contain carwashing companies with whom I am working with . 
The app is created for businessmans and comapanies that have a lot of cars and need them always be clean like car renting companies who ussally dont have time and for workers how work in those car washing companies. 
When the user enters the app they are asked to choose a district where they want to wash their car. 
When choosing one the app will show the prices for their services and the exact adress of the company.
After this the application will generate random code of four digites or letters, for the user and save it. 
People will be able to see the location of the companies and save time, as when they enter the code that application created for them they will be served without queue.
I have used json for other reason. In my code the file is generating special code for user in order for them to say or write that code in car-washing company and get serviced as soon as possible. To make this come true I need to save the code in a file so I have done it with the help of json file.
